We have completely done until Part 3 Step 4, included.

The commands needed for the compilation and execution of the script are:
-Compilation:
	gcc -g -Wall collection.c errors.c execute_schedule.c input_usr.c item.c menu.c program.c -o program
	gcc -g -Wall process.c -o process
-Execution:
	./program

//Some functions of collection.c, collection.h, errors.c, errors.h, the function get_input, item.c and item.h have been copied or inspired from the slides.

CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Whenever an input is asked to the user, if a specific data type is expected, the program won´t
    continue until the received input is of that data type. So, the program will only accept inputs
    from the expected data type:
        . Name: Chars or Integers.
        . PID: Integer.
        . Execution time: Integer.
        . Priority: Integer.
        . Yes or No: YES, Yes, yes, y, NO, No, no, n.
    If, the user does not introduce the expected data type, the program will repeatedly ask to
    introduce again the parameter as it has been impossible for the program to understand it.
    This will happen until the introduced parameter is correct.

    - When the user is asked to introduce Yes or No, as mentioned above, there are some more valid
    answers such as: YES, Yes, yes, y, NO, No, no, n .
    If, another group of chars is introduced, the program won´t inderstand it and will ask the user to
    introduce again an answer to the question. In the case where the user introduces an integer,
    the same procedure will happen.
